# Applying K-Means, Fuzzy-C-mean and-Support Vector Machine on student grade dataset

# Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ouline/student-mat-pass-or-fail

# Problem Statement
This project aims to find out the influence of various variables and parameters on the grade of a secondary school student. The dataset is extensive with atleast 33 different variables which are then filtered for the most obvious predictors and analysis is performed to understand the influence of these predictors on the final grades of the students.

# Methodology Employed

(1) Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

(2) Elbow Method 

(3) K-Means Algorithm

(4) Fuzzy C-Mean using Alpha-cut

(5) Support Vector Machine ( SVM )


# Elbow Method 
 
The Elbow Method is a technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset for clustering algorithms. It helps identify the point of diminishing returns, where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the quality of the clustering. The method is applicable to algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and others

# Fuzzy C-Mean using Alpha-cut

Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a clustering algorithm that assigns membership values to data points, indicating the degree to which each point belongs to different clusters. It is based on the concept of fuzzy sets, where membership values can range from 0 to 1, representing the degree of belongingness.

Alpha-cut is a parameter used in fuzzy set theory that defines a threshold for membership values. It allows us to create a crisp set by considering only the elements with membership values above a certain level (alpha).

# Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving the most important information. PCA transforms the original variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. These components are ordered by their ability to explain the variance in the data. By selecting a subset of principal components, one can represent the data in a lower-dimensional space while retaining the most significant patterns and structures. PCA is widely used in data analysis, visualization, and feature extraction tasks.
